# Building an Accessibility Maturity Model

For all of the rigorous, technical requirements that define accessibility, it is truly a human pursuit. We research, design, develop, and test software so it can meet users where they are. We should not expect users to make accommodations; rather our products should have allowances built in that make them easier to use.

Creating software that meets these exacting requirements is a team effort. It requires the talent, energy, and contribution of every team member. It asks a lot, and there are many hurdles. These include, but are not limited to:

**Micro-practical challenges:**
* Personal bias - "It's such a big subject, I don't know where to start"
* Psychic cost - "I have too much to do as it is. I don't have time for one more thing."
* Fear of failure - "What if I make the product worse?"

**Macro-practical challenges:**
* Institutional bias - "Not our problem"
* Mis-understanding the market - "Our users don't browse with screen readers"

## Micro-practical Challenges
Micro-practical challenges exist at the individual level and can persist up to a practice or discipline.

In my experience, these looked and sounded like negatively-reinforcing thoughts, and anxiety about "breaking something". There wasn't a clear understanding of what exactly I might break, but I was pretty sure I had no business wading into a practice area I wasn't trained for, and more importantly, believed I was not qualified for.

## Macro-practical Challenges
Macro-practical challenges are created by a large number of micro-practical challenges. Macros start emerging at the practice or discipline, and can be present all the way to the institutional level.

Macro-practical challenges can take several forms. The one I am most familiar with is the 'Not Our Problem` fallacy. This is an attitude that projects indiffernce, but can be a mask for fear and uncertainty. It is easier to deflect responsibility than embrace it and the costs that go with it.

The other macro-practical challenge I have seen is a mis-understanding of a target market. It is unwise to assume "our users don't browse with screen readers." 15-20% of the public identify with some level of diminished capacity. This can be situational, temporary, or permanent, but software should not be an arbiter or a roadblock.

## Construct Your Model by Accepting Where You Are
To build a vibrant maturity model, one that individuals, teams, pratices, and institutions will actually follow, you must first come to terms with where you are.

We are proposing a 3-part model, and will use the terms `Phobic`, `Green`, and `Centric` to help you identify a starting point, and rally to a clearly defined goal.

### Phobic - Starting Out
Phobic individuals, practices, and institutions (hereby collectively known as groups) have a high level of anxiety about accessibilty. They are unsure how to find information, what tools to use, or how they can contribute. If you find yourself or your team resisting or downplaying accessibilty requirements, you might be in a Phobic state of mind.

### Green - Making Progress
Green groups have overcome the fear of getting started. The group has invested psychic energy and resources to make accessibility a part of their process. They are working to improve their products and spread knowledge to their peers and teammates.

### Centric - Achieving Balance
Centric groups have made significant, measurable gains for accessibility. This includes the software they develop, and the knowledge they share and provide for others. Centric teams don't make sweeping gains in compliance; they make steady ones that build on previous work and capture knowledge gained as a result.
